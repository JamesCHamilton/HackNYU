# HackNYU Project

## Summary of the Project

This project was developed during HackNYU, a 48-hour hackathon hosted by NYU students worldwide.  
The hackathon encourages participants to create innovative technology projects addressing various societal issues.  
[Visit HackNYU](https://hacknyu.org) for more details.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Nextjs + tailwind 
- **Backend**: Expressjs
- **Apis**: Cataas + dog.ceo + google Maps places
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas  

## Instructions to Run Locally

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository from GitHub.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JamesCHamilton/HackNYU.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project's root directory.

    cd HackNYU
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies for both frontend and backend.

   # For frontend
    cd frontend
    npm install
    
  # For backend
    cd ../backend
    npm install
4. **Run the Application**: Start both the frontend and backend servers (two different terminals).

   # For frontend
    cd frontend
    npm start
  
  # For backend
    cd ../backend
    npm start
5. **Access the Application**: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

## Challenges and Learnings from the Project

  Participating in HackNYU provided an opportunity to tackle real-world problems within a constrained timeframe.
  One of the significant challenges was effective time management and the challenged I imposed on myself by working by myself, ensuring that the project was both       functional and innovative within the 48-hour window.

## Future Plans
  Future enhancements for this project may include:

  - **Feature Expansion**: Adding more functionalities based on user feedback and emerging technologies.
  - **Performance Optimization**: Improving the application's efficiency and responsiveness.
  - **User Interface Improvements**: Enhancing the design for better user experience.
  - **Deployment**: Making the application accessible to a broader audience by deploying it on a reliable platform.
